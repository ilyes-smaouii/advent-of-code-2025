Personal attempt at Advent of Code 2025

## Intro/context
After finishing the 2024 edition a few weeks ago, I'll try participating in the
2025 edition, this time as it's being released, rather than months later.

## Journal/misc
### 2025/11/30
Created the repo a few hours before the release of first Day's instructions.
\
Will report back tomorrow when I've had my look at the first Day.

### 2025/12/01
Look at Day 1, solved it pretty quickly, currently reading part 2 of Day 1.
\
Update : had a bit of trouble on part 2 cause I forgot to use `abs()` on an int variable I had,
but I got it in the end.
\
Will report back tomorrow for Day 2.

### 2025/12/02
Just read Part 1 of Day 2, and I already have some ideas besides the bruteforce approach -
which, if I'm trying to anticipate could be useful for Part 2 -, e.g. using the fact that
invalid IDs will be multiples of 1 + 10^n where n > 0;
\
Update : had a bit of trouble, switched to the simple approach of using strings, and after
fishing out a but, I figured it out. Now onto Part 2.

### 2025/12/03
Couldn't finish Day 2 last night as I was busy, and I was trying to think of an efficient
approach, but I just ended up using a slow solution.
\
I'll try to read and do Day 3 later today, I've got other stuff to take care of right now.

### 2025/12/04
Update on Part 1 of Day 03 : didn't have time to code it yesterday as I was out, but I took
some notes on my phone, and after a minor correction it worked straight away. Now onto
Part 2.

### 2025/12/05
Update on yesterday : wrote the code for Day 03 fairly quickly, but it kept crashing. It turned out
my test data wasn't properly initialized, which caused the continous crashes. Got the right answer
once I fixed that.
\
I'd also started to look at Day 04 and to think about it, although I couldn't really write code yet.
I'm now starting to write the code.
\
Update : made a lot of stupid mistake, but I'm now done with Part 1. Moving on to Part 2.
\
Update : solved it, although I'm not too happy with the speed of my code. Anyway, I'm not wasting
any more time on this. Moving on to Day 05.
