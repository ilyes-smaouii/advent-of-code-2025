Personal attempt at Advent of Code 2025

## Intro/context
After finishing the 2024 edition a few weeks ago, I'll try participating in the
2025 edition, this time as it's being released, rather than months later.

## Journal/misc
### 2025/11/30
Created the repo a few hours before the release of first Day's instructions.
\
Will report back tomorrow when I've had my look at the first Day.

### 2025/12/01
Look at Day 1, solved it pretty quickly, currently reading part 2 of Day 1.
\
Update : had a bit of trouble on part 2 cause I forgot to use `abs()` on an int variable I had,
but I got it in the end.
\
Will report back tomorrow for Day 2.

### 2025/12/02
Just read Part 1 of Day 2, and I already have some ideas besides the bruteforce approach -
which, if I'm trying to anticipate could be useful for Part 2 -, e.g. using the fact that
invalid IDs will be multiples of 1 + 10^n where n > 0;
\
Update : had a bit of trouble, switched to the simple approach of using strings, and after
fishing out a but, I figured it out. Now onto Part 2.

### 2025/12/03
Couldn't finish Day 2 last night as I was busy, and I was trying to think of an efficient
approach, but I just ended up using a slow solution.
\
I'll try to read and do Day 3 later today, I've got other stuff to take care of right now.
