Personal attempt at Advent of Code 2025

## Intro/context
After finishing the 2024 edition a few weeks ago, I'll try participating in the
2025 edition, this time as it's being released, rather than months later.

## Journal/misc
### 2025/11/30
Created the repo a few hours before the release of first Day's instructions.
\
Will report back tomorrow when I've had my look at the first Day.

### 2025/12/01
Look at Day 1, solved it pretty quickly, currently reading part 2 of Day 1.
\
Update : had a bit of trouble on part 2 cause I forgot to use `abs()` on an int variable I had,
but I got it in the end.
\
Will report back tomorrow for Day 2.
